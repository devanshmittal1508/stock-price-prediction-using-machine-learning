# stock-price-prediction-using-machine-learning
This project predicts stock price using machine learning model namely linear regression
The model was trained using TCS real life dataset dated from(12 aug 2002 to 12 may 2023).
The model is capable to predict real life unseen stock price of next day , average of next week and average of next month.
The model uses parameters such as Date, Open, High, Low, Volume to predict the parameter close.
The project also shows the result with proper visualization at the end.

Libraries used are as follows:-
Panda, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, datetime.

The project works in following steps;
1 importing required libraries
2 Importing dataset using pandas
3 Data Exploration
4 Data preprocessing
5 Data spiliting
6 Data visualization
7 Model fitting
8 Model testing
9 Prediction
10 Result visualization
11 Prediction on real life unseen data
12 Prediction results

# Project Results
Model trained with good training accuracy and give good testing acccuracy and was even capable to predict next day results with 99 percent accuracy.
